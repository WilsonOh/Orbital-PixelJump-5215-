## Running the game
### Run the packaged executable
Go to `releases` and follow the instructions for your OS
The packaged executables are only tested on limited hardware so there may be some problems that we have not faced.
The most reliable way is to run the program from source, which will be explained below.
### Running from source
1. Make sure you have `python3.10` installed. You can download and install it from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Clone the repo and `cd` into it
3. Install `pygame` by running `pip install pygame` to install it globally, or create a python `venv`<sup>[1]</sup> and install it there
4. If you're using a `venv`, activate it and then run `python3 src/main.py`

[1] Create a `venv` by running `python3 -m venv venv`
